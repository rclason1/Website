<!-- Program Goals -->




<br><br><br><div class="header">Program Goals</div>
<p class="p">The Careers In Education Academy is a California Partnership Academy, funded by the California Department
 of Education and District/Community partners. California Partnership Academies are designed to function 
 as small-schools-within-a-school for at-risk students and other students looking for a more personal
 educational experience. Our Academy provides individual teacher-to-student support, a dedicated team 
 of teachers and support staff, cross-curricular units and projects, and a focus on developing life-skills 
 and gaining the tools to become eligible to attend college. Although we focus on "Careers in Education," 
 the skills and knowledge that students gain during their time in our Academy will help them on their path
 to success in any profession or other endeavor.</p>


<div class="header">Our History</div>

<p class="p">The YVHS Careers in Education Academy began in the Fall of 2001, by our founder, Mrs. Laura Hallberg.
 Mrs. Hallberg (formerly known as Ms. Aguado and Ms. Delgadillo)
 taught at YVHS for 19 years and ran the Education Academy for most of her time here. 
 She is a visionary educator who created a rigorous and well-respected program in the Education Academy. 
 Mrs. Hallberg continues to light the way for young minds as a middle school Vice Principal in Brentwood, CA. 
 The first ever Education Academy class began with forty sophomore students and has since grown to accommodate
 over 150 progressing sophomores, juniors, and seniors each year. </p>
